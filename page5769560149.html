<p>The bCLEARer approach<span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="255f638b-abdc-473d-81f7-a739989dbbcc"> is architected to</span> uncover opportunities for digital evolution and to rapidly exploit them. The initial stages of the approach are ones of discovery, where the process evolves to meet the emerging requirements and so usually involves radical change. </p><p>Given the need to support rapid evolutionary change, including radical change, the bCLEARer approach needs to be resilient, to thrive rather than collapse when faced with change. Any <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="658c2606-7a53-4c3b-bda6-4ff514c4a663">resilient system</span> must strike a<span style="color: rgb(255,86,48);"> </span>good balance between stability and flexibility. The bCLEARer approach has evolved to be resilient – to facilitate radical change. </p><p>The aim of this report is to provide a foundation for the resilient inspection practices that have emerged in the bCLEARer approach over the last three decades. These exploit ways of identifying, tracking, tracing and testing what information there is and how it is transformed. Adopting these core practices helps to build trust in the bCLEARer digital transformations.</p><a name="Bookmark4"></a><h1 id="Bookmark4">Right balance of principles and rules</h1><p> Any resilient system must strike a<span style="color: rgb(255,86,48);"> </span>good balance between stability and flexibility. It must have stable elements that persist through change and flexible elements that can adapt to changes. From an ecosystem perspective, the stable infrastructure can be regarded as the environment in which the transformations unfold and evolve.</p><p>This good balance of stability and flexibility <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="d3cdc3db-98e0-4092-8be0-9f71565cced4">is </span>needs to be reflected in framing the approach within the <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="5b6b1c77-0d3d-43de-9ec4-ea78b58698be">right balance of principles and rules</span> – particularly algorithmic rules -, see <a data-card-appearance="inline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" href="https://borocvi.atlassian.net/l/cp/kSZJbnMy" title="https://borocvi.atlassian.net/l/cp/kSZJbnMy">https://borocvi.atlassian.net/l/cp/kSZJbnMy</a>. Where principles describe the broad aims and trust in the commitment of those executing them, whereas rules specify narrow, potentially rigid, constraints upon what can and cannot be done. </p><a name="Bookmark5"></a><h2 id="Bookmark5">Rules</h2><p>Rules aim to provide a structure that is, in theory, sufficient for resolving a particular type of case. They might seem to provide certainty and a clear standard of behaviour. They might seem to be easier to apply consistently. But it is difficult for rules to be congruent with their purpose, to achieve what it is they are intended to achieve. Rules are based upon a “best guess” as to the future. The rulemaker has to anticipate how the rule will be applied in the future. But new situations may arise that were not expected or known about when the rule was written. The rule may be interpreted and applied in ways that were not intended or anticipated by the writer. In practice, this not only leads to gaps, inconsistencies, rigidity, but is prone to degeneration into “creative compliance” (where the letter is followed but not the spirit). This creates a need for constant adjustment to new situations. This can then then lead to a ‘<span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="45bb6a5e-299d-47b0-b03f-f3ad5e70d4b4">ratchet syndrome</span>’, where more rules are created to address new problems or close new gaps, creating more gaps and so on.</p><a name="Bookmark6"></a><h2 id="Bookmark6">Principles</h2><p>Principles are typically more general and focus on purpose rather than process. This makes them more flexible without sacrificing congruence with their purpose. The execution of both rules and principles rely upon being understood, a shared understanding in the case of teams. However, in the case of principles there is typically a need for a wider and deeper understanding to interpret the principles in the way intended, or even suitably extend the interpretation to novel situations. </p><a name="Bookmark7"></a><h2 id="Bookmark7"><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="2df1beda-95e2-48f2-89ad-e498e2843bdc">Principles and rules</span></h2><p>Given the variety of situations in which bCLEARer is deployed and the requirement for rapid evolution and the associated radical change, rules by themselves are not the right tool for the job. Principles have a better initial fit for the bCLEARer situation. So there is no choice but to start with a principle-based approach. However, the requirement for a repeatable, scalable process means that in the end, the bCLEARer process needs to be developed as largely (computer-)executable rules. </p><p>The aim of this report is to describe the principles that underlie the bCLEARer approach to resilient transparency as well as start to develop some understanding of the kinds of executable rules that should be developed.</p><a name="Bookmark8"></a><h1 id="Bookmark8">Report structure</h1><p>The approach is outlined in the body of the report, in two main sections:</p><ul><li><p>A resilient, transparent bCLEARer pipeline architecture</p></li><li><p>Building resilient transformation transparency into the bCLEARer pipeline</p></li></ul><p>The first section focuses on the pipeline architecture of the overall approach. This is the infrastructure that provides the stability that any resilient system requires to remain flexible in the face of change. </p><p>The second section describes how transformation transparency is built into the bCLEARer pipelines based upon notions of identity. It focuses on how to build in transparency from the bottom up.  Then how to exploit this to identify, track, trace and test what information there is and how it is transformed. </p>
